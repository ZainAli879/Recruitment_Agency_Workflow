# Recruitment Agency Workflow (LangGraph)

Welcome!  
This project is an **automated recruitment workflow** designed to streamline how job applications are processed and routed using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **graph-based logic**.

---

##  What Does This Do?

This workflow automatically processes job applications by:

-  **Categorizing candidates** as:
  - Entry-level
  - Mid-level
  - Senior-level

-  **Evaluating** if their skills match the job requirements.

-  **Making decisions based on the evaluation**:
  -  If the candidate is a **good fit**, schedules an **HR interview**.
  -  If the candidate is **senior** but doesn’t fully match, escalates to a **recruiter**.
  -  If the candidate is **entry or mid-level** and doesn’t match, sends a **rejection**.

All handled programmatically using **LangGraph** — enabling **clear**, **modular**, and **dynamic** workflows.

---

##  Why Use This?

Recruitment often involves:
- Repetitive tasks
- Complex decision-making  

This tool **automates** those tasks, **saves time**, and ensures **fair & consistent** handling of applications.

**Graph-based logic** also allows easy visualization and flexibility to extend the system.
